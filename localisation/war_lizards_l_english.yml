 HOLY_SITE_2312_DESC: "Hexoatl, the "City of the Sun," is the northernmost temple-city, located on the Isthmus of Pahuax. It's Lustria’s first line of defence against Northern invaders. The Grey Guardians, a sentient mountain range created by Lord Mazdamundi can be found two hundred miles north of Hexoatl. Raised to block the Dark Elf armies that threaten to overwhelm the city, the mountains proved so effective that the Mage-Priest made the enchantment permanent."
 HOLY_SITE_2466_DESC: "tza, called the "First City," is the greatest of the surviving temple-cities of the Lizardmen and is home to the most powerful and ancient practitioners of magic to be found anywhere in the Known World. Foremost amongst them is the venerable Slann relic priest, Lord Kroak, whose indomitable spirit has guarded Itza against the return of Chaos since the Great Catastrophe. Although it has been hard-pressed on several occasions, never once has Itza yielded to an attacker."
 HOLY_SITE_2442_DESC: "Quetza, also known as "the Defiled," is an abandoned Lizardmen temple-city that served as a powerbase for the Skaven of Clan Pestilens during their sojourn in Lustria."
 HOLY_SITE_4296_DESC: "Zlatlan, the "Hidden City," is the greatest Lizardmen temple-city within the Southlands and one of the few that remains intact and inhabited by the Lizardmen on that continent. The Slann mage-priests of Zlatlan are unable to maintain contact with those of Lustria via telepathic links because of the curvature of the earth. The Slann communicate thoughts and magical energy along lines traced out across the jungle from one pyramid to another. The expanse of the World Pond and the curve of the world's surface prevent such a line between Lustria and the Southlands."
 HOLY_SITE_4807_DESC: " This settlement that lies in the centre of the jungles of Khuresh was one of the temple-cities created by the Old Ones to accomplish their Great Plan with the help of their foremost servants, the Lizardmen."
 HOLY_SITE_4265_DESC: "Similar to the temple-cities of the Southlands, the Lizardmen colonies on the Dragon Isles were cut off from their masters many centuries ago, but the degradation of their culture was much more rapid and pronounced. Without any Slann to lead them, the local Skinks and Saurus have reverted completely to barbarism, becoming little more than beasts and destroying what little remained of their former glory in bitter conflict. Whether the Slann of Lustria have attempted to establish communications with the lost kin or have simply abandoned them to their fate is unclear, but certainly there has been little or no contact between Lustria and the Dragon Isles for hundreds of years."
 HOLY_SITE_4383_DESC: "A Lizardmen temple-city stands on the Volcanic Isles, different from all others in Lustria. It is not a "living" city, nor was it abandoned. Rather, the City of the Dead is a necropolis, home to the Lizardmen's honoured dead. These Skinks, Saurus, and occasionally Kroxigor are honoured with an interment in the City of the Dead, watched over by those Relic Priests with no temple-city of their own."
 HOLY_SITE_4261_DESC: "Nestled deep within the verdant and hostile jungles of the Dragon Isles, this ancient Lizardmen temple city stands as a testament to the Old Ones' divine design."
