###### RANDOM TO DOS ########
#############################

	Use on_war_won (or equivalent) with national set_flags to set the racial war missions

	Bjornling culture is bjornling not skraeling, Kislev is also Gospodar not Kislevite

	East and West Lustrian Coastilne names permutated: green is named as western coast (should be east) while red is named as eastern coast (should be west)

	As Etaine I colonized some provinces in Dawn's Light (Equivalent to South Africa) but can't add them to a trade company. For references, I have all DLCs.

	Bret missions need better tooltips

	Master The Art of Boarding tells you to capture 20 ships while having the Boarding naval doctrine active, but there are no naval doctrines selectable even with a 60+ ship fleet

	Remove restriction that you can't declare war while in the Karak 8 peak war.
		Simplify this whole thing

	Bretonia reforms need grail knights back in, but hussar issue

	Make sure all the prov_names_adj are correct

	Grail Quest is all strange
		I would suggest changing the nature of the grail quest, because every time i try it i just get another heir before they come back, meaning louen is effectively the only grail knight you're ever going to get, maybe change it into a series of events? 

	The MTTH for age decadence events should be looked at. Currently for any country with a ruler over 350 (So basically all elves, undead, the cathayan dragons, and probably more) age decadence events trigger, on average, every 53 months. Given how strong the negative effects of these events are, and how comparatively rare the counterpart age revival events are, (On average once every 140 months) it should trigger much less frequently.

	Rethink Raiding, chat with Theia
		WHAT IF RACIAL RAIDING IS AN END OF WAR PEACE OFFERING? THAT TAKES 75 WARSCORE? But that would mean you actually need to win the war, which kind of defeats the purpose

	Replace Comet event with Twin Tailed Comet Event

	Missions
		Make all missions a little harder
		Balance Mission Rewards
		Make Generic Beacon of power harder
		Make racial rewards a little less?

	Give the racial admin tooltips that also explain the terrain thing

	Make release dominion action (that AI never do)

	On the latest patch 8/12/2024, strong stacks of beastmen assault the province repeatedly, roughly once every 2 to 3 years triggering via event.
		To wrap a minor suggestion into this, maybe beeckerhaven could have a province modifier that lets you remove the warherd via decision

	Also on this note, actually forming Estalia and accepting the new ideas thing swaps you to generic ones?
		Same thing happens when forming albion, although I'm not sure if that's intentional or not in that case tho?

	Skavenblight trade node is funky. Nevermind, its actually where skavenblight is in lore. Although i'd argue still to move it to ease confusion and also for practically nations in skavenblight itself can't get trade from it.

	Audacity Brettonian mission not working

	Not sure if this is a bug but why do some nations only have one tradition? Example Stirland, Averland, and Talabecland

	The Nehekharan Pantheon should have a decision you can take every so often which allows you to switch which diety you follow, since your rulers are immortal you're locked in unless you choose to get them killed

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	Playtest Bretts

	Add some token trade modifier to all artifacts so that they can be seen on the trade map

	Khorne Sacrifice events and decisions working?

	How to represent Beastmen?

	When the emperor (of the empire) dies they should get 10 imperial authority (like the base game) 
		And for some reason you lose your bretonnian imperial vassals after some time and they become duke of some random bretonian king

	Raid Neighbors Wood Elf Mission
		Correct me if i'm wrong but this was implemented with all provinces scope and checked for neighbor provinces when it could be scoped directly to neighbors, couldn't it?

	tried swapping to a theocracy as the albion fimir, it just took away two reform tiers and i stayed tribal, monarchy worked fine, havent tried republic

	It doesn't seem to go through if you full annex a race, and I would also suggest promoting a culture should work in place of trust but that's just me.

	Gell's suggested flavor decisions/events: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1315325752035770490/1315327269371379712

	Remove Dev Cost from state edicts

	When you form a subject over a brettonian duke and a new royarch gets crowned they become their subject again

	is a dominion meant to cost twice as much AE as non-dominions?

	Missing localization - Im not entirely sure what they're referencing, but B27_ADJ ought to point at a particular nation, they rose out of Vorag's cores.

	Fimir bonus in swamp

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Bretonnia has only one monument as well, I would have at least expected a vinyard or the like, or a port that buffs up their navy to reflect the lore of them having a really damn strong navy
		Bordeleaux should have either a port or a vinyard, and Moussilion is think would probbaly deserve a monument as well
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?

	Colonial Nation's Localization now works?

	Restore Reman Empire correct

	Subjects don't do racial raiding!

	Decadence comes with age - too penalizing? Half the costs? or get rid of them, or give it a choice

	"The world moves too fast event" should only cause one stab loss?

	Fix Monstrous Unit Cost?

	Add Uzkulak Canal picture

######## MAP STUFF #######
#############################

	Provinces in wrong physical place: 19, 31, 110, 134, 217, 271, 316, 580, 581, 584, 569, 593, 593, 616, 634, 762, 789, 789, 2349, 2350  Greyspire Fortress, Silent Gulf 

	It seems the issue is that the ships are going to explore "debug_province (Sea)". When exploring this sea tile the ships go to the inexistent Silent Gulf and come back.


	Starting the thread with two sea tiles being connected: Sharkfang Bay (1457) and Wailing Maw (1321)


	Lore wise there should be a conection between Sjoktraken to Kraka Ravnsvake via the underground tunnel called the Ungruvalk

	Attempting to walk through Jaraiz from the irrana mountains state group to go to belemoz will make you path irregularly.

	Most of the Irrana Mountains need slight position nudging too, which you can do ingame by activating nudge mode, by putting -nudge in the startup console in steam -> eu4 -> properties.

	Units disappear when in certain tiles: Roughly the title, particularly tiles within the dwarven halls have this issue but I didn't see it playing as Karak Eight Peaks dwarves. Do appear when sieging for some reason. Also happens in 'The Vaults' with Gorr  + Rikkit (Tunnels to Skavenblight) and Thrash (Clan Scurvy Tunnels), i closed my thread i hadn't seen yours. Kurn + Thragg for the Irrana Tunnels state too. 

	Odd visual bug when playing Brettonia, when armies are fighting they disappear from the map, would make it impossible to retreat an army from a losing battle. the orcs right next to marienburg and courounne seemingly

	Northern Verge is connected to Shatterskulls, and it shouldn't be

	Dissapearing battles bug also happens in the Laurelorn group of provinces.

	Add Gromil as a resource

		I think the Vaults Trade node doesnt make sense getting money from karaz - a - Karak lore wise. I think it makes more sense that it works as a starting node (a rich one but still one) that sends to Karaz - a - Karak as lore wise Karaz - a - Karak is the center of dwarven economics since before the fall of the karaz Ankor, especially without Karak Eight Peaks. 
		Its a Underway junctions getting the northern holds and those in the vaults, in the same way Vala Azril Ungol was a great underway junction from the southern holds.
		Elf trade network stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315004963214200913

	I think the River Reik would enjoy being navigable, at least until Altdorf, After all after Mariengburg´s secession, the 1st Imperial Fleet is housed in its docks.

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	Many more cultures! Double the number of cultures in each culture group.

	In averlorn i´d change the Gaen Vale to farmland (or hills if you dont want to stack too much dev reduction on the province) and put the magical forest in the slopes of the Anuilli mountains

	Do we need immortal? Or just increase lifespan

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Add Faceting and other events that change the price of goods

	Add in Beastmen as a playable faction.

	Necromancer and Vampire nations should be able to create set armies by decision/spell (if spell system is ever added) from nothing

	Decision for Greenskin and Skaven administrations to raid own lands!

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Decolonize Dragon isles? You could always give those dragon isle lizardmen the stateless society reform as a tribal government. Allow for them to reform into a normal nation again if they get some alternative means of directing society

	kislev cav is so dirt cheap lmao, I has it as same cost of infantry within the first 20 years

	Throughout the game you get the option to steal legendary artifacts once you siege an enemy capital. These artifacts give your country permanent bonuses, althought the coolest part is the roleplay aspect of it imo.

	When searching for them though, I wasn't able to see which ones I had stolen, or which bonuses they give me.

	It would be cool to have a window where we could see these artifacts, what they do, and maybe a bit of they story: original from X, stolen by Y, taken by you as a final owner.

	New Religion
		Vim-toism or Simcism for Nippon: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315711285383659562/1315711285383659562

	Add Nations
		Boris Ursus' faction from the Chaos Wastes
		Add Skarbrand and Exhiles of Khorne. And Ku’gath
		A lost legion of curious geaser on Albion
		Fimir Nation in the darklands: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315712050965647390/1315712050965647390
			8E and Fantasy Roleplay 4E state that Fimir are mostly concentrated in the wetlands of northern and western Old World (ie. largely concentrated in Norsca and Wastelands), but they are present elsewhere too, such as in Albion and Hybrasille (theorised to the new island shown in most recent maps of the Old World west of Albion).


	New Formables/Reformables
		Kislev should be made a reformable nations for cultures of Gospodar and Ungol culture groups.
		Nippon should be similarly reformable for cultures in Nipponese culture group.
		Hobgoblin Khanate should be available to form for Hobgoblin countries.
		Khuresh could be implemented as a formable for the Khureshi Snakefolk nations.
		Osterlund for those who wish to restablish this country by conquering or subjugating Nordland, Osland and Middenland. Each of 		Zharr-Naggrund should be reformable by the chaos dwarves, and the chaos dwarves should have a formable if they control the dark lands and/or the karaz ankor
			Dhrath-Zharr-Ankor as a potential namethose countries should get option to form it.


	Who is missing National Ideas:
		Amazonia

	Every Age should have a big bad?
		Orcs, Lizardfolk (old Ones), Nagash,

	Decision to get Nagash as a ruler
	
	Go on a quest decision - take your ruler to a randomly set province on a different continent, maybe fight a rebel army there.

	Ask other modders (anbennar) for 3d models?

	Fix HRE gfx (hre.gui)

	Make Everchosen A Theocracy to make it stickier?

	"Canals" from the Oak to other places

	Add 3 advisors gfx per race + 1 female one

	Make Lizardfolk Enlightened Path = Harmony? Or give it a unique GFX

	Age Bonuses
		Be a Ruinous power with over 200 development
		or
		Be at war with a Ruinous power

	Event for a high elf country to go dark elf culture/religion

	for Sylvania is there any way like event or anything to get that bald pretender Manfred off the throne and get Vlad and his lady back on?

	Add Panama Canal
	Disaster and event series for high elves to unify and fight off invaders if they land in ulthuan. number of provinces owned by a nation not of the right religion or culture.
		Or just an event that encourages high elves to do it - if you declar war, you get prestige and more trust and love with everybody else on the island.

	End Times Drama
		Being next to the everchosen (or any chaos dude) makes rebels spawn in that province?

	Recently Raided is weird. Maybe you can't undo the decision while at war, buut your warscore is 2x the cost?
	But then you can't selectively raid?
	Should it go away at the end of the war? Clear all recently raided?

	Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
	Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!

	Worry about military balance

	Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
	Offer to become dominion action?
	Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)
	Convert Them

	Is it possible to be both a race and undead? Undead human, undead orc? And gain both the racial and undead adm/military qualities

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	Adjust Age Bonuses and Localization for Age bonuses

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

	Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map, with legendary traits

	Make end times start a country event, not a province event

	Use on-actions to Tie administration & mil to primary culture

	Intolerant, with decision to get rid of it

	Make all the tech ground and administration & military stuff come from primary culture?

	Norsca Nation can choose to civilize

	Send raiding party ability to lose manpower, damage relationship, and spawn a rebel army in an adjacent country

	At start of end times all good nations like each other more

	Fightiness events that give manpower don't give manpower if you're already above max? They give mil power or something else?

	Add some islands? Increase colonial range?

	Everchosen Cannot convert?

	Finish Starting localization

#############################
######### NAH STUFF #########
#############################

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process


Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.

Brettonia
	jeff you should add a debuff for the developpement for bretonia



Vampires

Wood Elves
	knowing this. What do you think of a conection between the Oak of Ages and the Gaen Vale as in the world roots, perhaps unlockable through a mission (like you do with Eordand or Cyranvar in Anbennar)


Dark Elf
	Also, Naggarond shouldn't be single nation, no? Maybe it should be vassal swarm where vassal can declare war on other vassal, but must participate in their overlord wars? And until Malekith don't capture Phoenix Throne, he would be unable to integrate them. 


High Elves
	Sword of Khaine Disaster
		Decision to start using
		Can't stop using while at war
		Stability cost to stop using
		Disaster if using for too long


Lizards
	have a government mechanic which makes them stronger for each geomantic web city they control spread like 50 around the world.
		Province Group?
		Number of Superregions?
	Spell to make devestation in all enemy lands

Dwarves

Dwarfs
	Hashut missions are a little strange
		Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them


Ogre

Nehekhara
	Tension between the Nekeharan Pantheon and Nagashi
	Nagashi religion to ressurect Nagash

Orcs
	5 pulse events to move towards mork or gork
	Mork interaction: raise rebels in adjacent territories
	Gork interaction: more manpower and gold
	Make the fightiness AI choose nobody if every neighboring is at least 2x stronger than them. Should add a little fightiness.


Cathay

Araby
	Skism in Araby - If a ruler is 666, then a chance for them to declare themselves a prophet

Tomb Kings/Nehekhara
	Make Nagash worship more mechanically interesting.
	Change 7th Dynasty requirements to subject counld own?

Rename Estates by using war_estates_l_english and common > estates > burgers, church, nobles. Look for "estate_haggle_masters"

	Replace Prestige gain with: add_prestige_or_monarch_power = { amount = 10 }
	Replace Stability gain with: add_stability_or_adm_power = yes
