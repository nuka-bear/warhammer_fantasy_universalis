	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	Ulthuan formable when ?

	On that note, the governing capacity reform remains in the Republican reforms. I do not know if this is intentional or an oversight, so I am just pointing that out. Overall, even in this early state, the mod somehow feels more fun than regular EU4. Good job!

	Highly enjoying the mod. Found a bug for HRE reforms. The expand the Witch Hunter's reform description says it grants +3% missionary vs Heathens for all empire provinces. However it is actually granting +3% global missionary vs Heathens for each empire province. This results in all heathen provinces having a <1 month conversion time, and I don't think that was the intent.

=======
	Move the Western Mountains out of the Underempire continent? Currently they are in the same continent as the main skaven underempire provinces, resulting in abnormaly high AE comrped to taking underway entrances  of other regions?
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

	Offer vassalization to dominions through the normal means?

	Change religion monuments to "is or accepts" with appropriate tooltips - does this work?

	Nurn cannot be added to the empire - It needs to be in the continent of europe to be able to. This makes it impossible to invite the southern border princes without going around through the black fire pass

	Two popups for ending the end times https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315782027534008420/1317095941404229662

	If they lose, Everchosen should get Fifth Monarchist collapse, or at least +20 unrest for 25 years.

    Implant cult can only target capitals if they are the only possible province

	Also its very strange to play Dark Elves border Princes. Your running around with Naggarondi Culture and Druchi Ideas on top of elven admin and military.
		Still somehow you get the Spanish Names
		The same with Antioch and getting muhammed as name

	I know its a minor detail but elves in Warhammer fantasy on avaradge live to 1000 years without the aid of magical means. (My guy is 985 so no problem for me but just something): https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1317188732939669657

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
	What Terrain should Haunted Marshes be? Rename something?

	Event for the reciever of the orc/skaven city raiding mission

	Change Chaos missions around estates

	The only option for if you want to 'reform' a chaos warband of a chaos waste culture into a government instead of playing tribal till the everchosen arrives.

	The norscan tribe gov-reform doesn't operate for Kurgan Culture, so is instantly suspended, however switching to the Tribes of Chaos would also mean you lose all your current territory and become migratory.

	There are 5+ provinces called wheatlands in this area, in a region called Wheatlands.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
	Could force raiding for AI allied with Players in a war, but that feels kinda cheaty. Maybe if they have a certain amount of trust?

	Final Empire Centralization reform doesn't work!

	Events for people administering wrong terrain type

	Balance Karak 8 Peak War
		Remove restriction that you can't declare war while in the Karak 8 peak war.
		Simplify this whole thing

	Vampiric/Nagash Disaster, similar to Chaos Corruption
	
	Use on_war_won (or equivalent) with national set_flags to set the racial war missions

	Norscan Monster Hunt Mana Doesn't go away
		Stays even after the monster hunt finishes and only dissapears once your leader dies
		though it seemingly is only affecting diplo, I don't have a -1 for military and admin

	As Etaine I colonized some provinces in Dawn's Light (Equivalent to South Africa) but can't add them to a trade company. For references, I have all DLCs.

	i dont think its possible to pass the reforms without fighting all the electors: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1316839640489263136

	Bret missions need better tooltips

	Events for Skaven nand orcs - bored war party - mneightbors get rebels (and you get opinion modifier), or you get rebels

	Grail Quest is all strange
		I would suggest changing the nature of the grail quest, because every time i try it i just get another heir before they come back, meaning louen is effectively the only grail knight you're ever going to get, maybe change it into a series of events? 

	The MTTH for age decadence events should be looked at. Currently for any country with a ruler over 350 (So basically all elves, undead, the cathayan dragons, and probably more) age decadence events trigger, on average, every 53 months. Given how strong the negative effects of these events are, and how comparatively rare the counterpart age revival events are, (On average once every 140 months) it should trigger much less frequently.

	Rethink Raiding, chat with Theia
		WHAT IF RACIAL RAIDING IS AN END OF WAR PEACE OFFERING? THAT TAKES 75 WARSCORE? But that would mean you actually need to win the war, which kind of defeats the purpose

	Missions
		Make all missions a little harder
		Balance Mission Rewards
		Make Generic Beacon of power harder
		Make racial rewards a little less?

	Give the racial admin tooltips that also explain the terrain thing

	On the latest patch 8/12/2024, strong stacks of beastmen assault the province repeatedly, roughly once every 2 to 3 years triggering via event.
		To wrap a minor suggestion into this, maybe beeckerhaven could have a province modifier that lets you remove the warherd via decision

	Also on this note, actually forming Estalia and accepting the new ideas thing swaps you to generic ones?
		Same thing happens when forming albion, although I'm not sure if that's intentional or not in that case tho?

	Skavenblight trade node is funky. Nevermind, its actually where skavenblight is in lore. Although i'd argue still to move it to ease confusion and also for practically nations in skavenblight itself can't get trade from it.

	Audacity Brettonian mission not working

	Not sure if this is a bug but why do some nations only have one tradition? Example Stirland, Averland, and Talabecland

	The Nehekharan Pantheon should have a decision you can take every so often which allows you to switch which diety you follow, since your rulers are immortal you're locked in unless you choose to get them killed
		Based on Norsca?

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	Playtest Bretts

	is a dominion meant to cost twice as much AE as non-dominions?

	Khorne Sacrifice events and decisions working?

	And for some reason you lose your bretonnian imperial vassals after some time and they become duke of some random bretonian king
		its from their crowning event
			When you form a subject over a brettonian duke and a new royarch gets crowned they become their subject again

	Raid Neighbors Wood Elf Mission
		Correct me if i'm wrong but this was implemented with all provinces scope and checked for neighbor provinces when it could be scoped directly to neighbors, couldn't it?

	tried swapping to a theocracy as the albion fimir, it just took away two reform tiers and i stayed tribal, monarchy worked fine, havent tried republic

	Expand empire diplomatically? Can it be done?

	More imperial Authority earned?

	It doesn't seem to go through if you full annex a race, and I would also suggest promoting a culture should work in place of trust but that's just me.

	Gell's suggested flavor decisions/events: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1315325752035770490/1315327269371379712

	Remove Dev Cost from state edicts

	When selecting to go on a Monster Hunt with Norsca, the game gives you 3 optoins on what to hunt, but the last one is missing localization as seen by the picutre. This was reproduced with Skaelings.
		At the end of a succesful hunt, the possitive modifiers have placeholder text for "norsca_mammoth_trophy" and "norscan_hunt_fatigue"

		https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1316502460411416596/1316502460411416596

	Trade
		I think the Vaults Trade node doesnt make sense getting money from karaz - a - Karak lore wise. I think it makes more sense that it works as a starting node (a rich one but still one) that sends to Karaz - a - Karak as lore wise Karaz - a - Karak is the center of dwarven economics since before the fall of the karaz Ankor, especially without Karak Eight Peaks. 
		Its a Underway junctions getting the northern holds and those in the vaults, in the same way Vala Azril Ungol was a great underway junction from the southern holds.
		Elf trade network stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315004963214200913

		its a little frustrating that the Worlds Edge Mountains trade nodes and the rest of the worlds trade nodes have almost no interaction whatsoever except at the very south of the whole range and the very north. it kinda makes it so that other than the 3 trade nodes in the main worlds edge mountains area, dwarfs really dont get to use any of the other trade nodes as theres no way to path them back to your capital. 
		Very odd considering there are 3 different times when a trade route passes through a mountain pass that directly leads to the inside trade nodes of the mountains, one of which literally passes within 1 province of the dwarves capitol. 
		i have more production in my country than the next 6 highest producers in the entire world all feeding into only 3 trade nodes, all of which i have 100% control over feeding into my capital node, and its still not enough to get the #1 most valuable trade node requirement for global trade
		Trade routes in general could probably use more movement, I notice a lot of beginner nodes that feel like they could make receive trade, or push in other directions


	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Bretonnia has only one monument as well, I would have at least expected a vinyard or the like, or a port that buffs up their navy to reflect the lore of them having a really damn strong navy
		Bordeleaux should have either a port or a vinyard, and Moussilion is think would probbaly deserve a monument as well
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

######## MAP STUFF #######

	Put on Dev Bounty Board

		The Golden Plains are isolated on water, with a single unclear crossing connection, with a crossing connection to Varn Drazh lake, but go to the adjacent Wheatlands Farmlands, if you built a fort on that province you wouldn't be able to figure out where the connection to the capital is when attempting to siege it.

		When i tried searching up Varn Drazh it drew me here. Based off the crossing info in the top left of the province screen. (i changed government to horde of chaos just to test id lose the land)
			The actual pool of water golden plains is on, is called cursed hollow

		4529 Has connections but is missing tunnels

		The provinces of Morcross and hauntcrag (Naggaroth) seem to be conected. I can also move there with my troops.

		Can build a boat in Ravola - It does finish building but is then invisible and can't move

		It seems the issue is that the ships are going to explore "debug_province (Sea)". When exploring this sea tile the ships go to the inexistent Silent Gulf and come back: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315784539653541918/1316214657245122611

		Sharkfang Bay (1457) and Wailing Maw (1321) are connected

		Sea Tiles "Northern Verge" and "Scorpions Coast" connected

		Lore wise there should be a conection between Sjoktraken to Kraka Ravnsvake via the underground tunnel called the Ungruvalk

		Northern Verge is connected to Shatterskulls, and it shouldn't be

		I think the River Reik would enjoy being navigable, at least until Altdorf, After all after Mariengburg´s secession, the 1st Imperial Fleet is housed in its docks.

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	I think you could Split colonial nations more. Like the Querveza (the green middle one in Lustria) could be split in 2 adding the Vampire Coast. Culchan the where the citadel of Dusk is could be split into a norther of the mountains and south of the mountains. 

	make accepting new cultures impossible, but culture converting cheaper.

	Add Cult of Sotek: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1316218273985200221/1316218273985200221

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	Many more cultures! Double the number of cultures in each culture group.

	In averlorn i´d change the Gaen Vale to farmland (or hills if you dont want to stack too much dev reduction on the province) and put the magical forest in the slopes of the Anuilli mountains

	Do we need immortal? Or just increase lifespan

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Add Faceting and other events that change the price of goods

	Add in Beastmen as a playable faction.

	Necromancer and Vampire nations should be able to create set armies by decision/spell (if spell system is ever added) from nothing

	Decision for Greenskin and Skaven administrations to raid own lands!

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	Gov reform that allows chaos, skaven ,orcs to raid

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Decolonize Dragon isles? You could always give those dragon isle lizardmen the stateless society reform as a tribal government. Allow for them to reform into a normal nation again if they get some alternative means of directing society

	kislev cav is so dirt cheap lmao, I has it as same cost of infantry within the first 20 years

	Throughout the game you get the option to steal legendary artifacts once you siege an enemy capital. These artifacts give your country permanent bonuses, althought the coolest part is the roleplay aspect of it imo.

	When searching for them though, I wasn't able to see which ones I had stolen, or which bonuses they give me.

	It would be cool to have a window where we could see these artifacts, what they do, and maybe a bit of they story: original from X, stolen by Y, taken by you as a final owner.

	New Religion
		Vim-toism or Simcism for Nippon: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315711285383659562/1315711285383659562

	Add Nations
		Boris Ursus' faction from the Chaos Wastes
		Add Skarbrand and Exhiles of Khorne. And Ku’gath

			8E and Fantasy Roleplay 4E state that Fimir are mostly concentrated in the wetlands of northern and western Old World (ie. largely concentrated in Norsca and Wastelands), but they are present elsewhere too, such as in Albion and Hybrasille (theorised to the new island shown in most recent maps of the Old World west of Albion).


	New Formables/Reformables
		Kislev should be made a reformable nations for cultures of Gospodar and Ungol culture groups.
		Nippon should be similarly reformable for cultures in Nipponese culture group.
		Hobgoblin Khanate should be available to form for Hobgoblin countries.
		Khuresh could be implemented as a formable for the Khureshi Snakefolk nations.
		Osterlund for those who wish to restablish this country by conquering or subjugating Nordland, Osland and Middenland. Each of 		Zharr-Naggrund should be reformable by the chaos dwarves, and the chaos dwarves should have a formable if they control the dark lands and/or the karaz ankor
			Dhrath-Zharr-Ankor as a potential namethose countries should get option to form it.

	Add Panama Canal
	Disaster and event series for high elves to unify and fight off invaders if they land in ulthuan. number of provinces owned by a nation not of the right religion or culture.
		Or just an event that encourages high elves to do it - if you declar war, you get prestige and more trust and love with everybody else on the island.

	End Times Drama
		Being next to the everchosen (or any chaos dude) makes rebels spawn in that province?

	Recently Raided is weird. Maybe you can't undo the decision while at war, buut your warscore is 2x the cost?
	But then you can't selectively raid?
	Should it go away at the end of the war? Clear all recently raided?

	Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands

######### NAH STUFF #########

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process


Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
